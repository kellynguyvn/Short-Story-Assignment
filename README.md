# Short Story Assignment
Submission by Kelly Nguyen for CMPE 255: Data Mining
## Abstract
This short story assignment highlights the study and findings of the paper “Privacy-preserving patient clustering for personalized federated learning” by Ahmed Elhussein and Gamze Gursoy from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University, presented at the Machine Learning for Healthcare 2023 conference. Eminently, uses of data mining tactics such as clustering in the style of federated learning have been explored in terms of preserving patient privacy in the healthcare field. This repository allows access to a medium article writtten on this, presentation slides, as well as a presentation recording.
